                Hi, I'm Sergio! I'm a web development student, building on my IT technician background. Passionate about design, I'm keen on improving and incorporating AI into my projects, especially for image creation and agilization of tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, gaming, and writing. My goal is to become a full-stack developer with a focus on front-end development. I'm fluent in Spanish, English, Catalan, and have a basic understanding of Russian.

            <h3><span class="emoji">üè∞</span>Budapest Internship.</h3>
            <p>
                I spent 3 months in Hungary, participating in the Erasmus+ project from Europe. What I did, mainly, was to act as a support for their wordrpess pages: I developed the functionalities that their pages were missing because of wordrpess' limitations, aswell as designing the web "MyBuda". The other page that I worked with, Bgazrt, was a whole project about accessibility for people with difficulties. (Keyboard navigation, SEO, screen reading software compatibilities...)

            <h3><span class="emoji">‚öîÔ∏è</span> Tales of Fae'Gir, my roleplaying wiki.</h3>
            <p>
                This is one of my dearest projects. I started it to practice both HTML and CSS, specially in the media-query regard. But Furthermore, I started using it to practise my design skills, adding to it A LOT of AI image generation, which ended up being the main point.
                It's still in development, and I plan to add some javascript to include dinamysm to the images. All the icons and landscapes are made by me, including ALL of the characters. The AI used was mostly MidJourney.

            <h3><span class="emoji">üêâ</span>Dungeons & Dragons Character Sheet.</h3>
            <p>
                This is another one of my personal projects. It's a simple yet attractive design for a web, where I just
                intend to use it as a 'base' for Dungeons & Dragons or roleplay characters of my making. It has some css,
                and I plan to adapt it to MVC.

            <p>This was my final project during my degree. I did it with my colleague Carlos, and the main point was to pick up a project from past years, and develop the skills necessary to understand "foreign" code, work, and improve on it. So it was an app that was already made, but we had to fix and improve.

            <p>This is a group project I did for my client subject. It was the first time I tried generating AI images,
                but with the help of my colleage Luis, we managed to make a somewhat entertaining graphic adventure about
                The Hobbit, with some decision making and extra mechanics such as randomness and health points.

                So this was my first ever portfolio for the different subjexts I had during the degree of
                 Web App Developer. You can see in it the different small projects I did for the first semester
                  in each category.
